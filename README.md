# Project Sea Eagle
System to classify chest x-rays based on diagnosis

## How does it work?
Using a TensorFlow backend, the system is trained on hundreds of thousands of chest x-rays to classify each, and learn patterns. This is applied to a test image which is given to the system, returing a list of potential diangnoses with confidence levels for each.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
